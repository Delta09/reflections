1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When you initialize a repository it tells git that I am going to start uploading and saving these files. It esentially creates a .git file.
We need to do it inorder to start making commits.

2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
staging area only prepares the files in the working directory to be added to the repository.
